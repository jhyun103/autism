Background
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is the most successful and highly recommended treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The goal of ABA is to use techniques, such as prompting and task analysis, to break concepts and behaviors down into teachable steps (youtube example: https://youtu.be/SLBLnNxzftM). It is one that has shown the best results for educators within public and private school systems, and data collection is a vital component.

Data collection allows everyone who teaches the child to stay on the same page.  Parents and educators work together to shape behaviors and teach concepts, and therefore it is important that both parties are aware of what is going on. A child may perform well at home but not at school, or vice versa. In such cases, data collection and visualization play a key role in allowing parents and educators to work together to see what differences are creating the problem.  They also allow all parties to determine the behaviors that are the most immediately necessary so that everyone can work on teaching the same thing.
