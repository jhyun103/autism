Objective
To help teachers better understand student data and follow student progress, which at the same time helps improve teacher performance.

Audience (user)
Teachers of special education (Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD).

Background
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is the most successful and highly recommended treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The goal of ABA is to use techniques, such as prompting and task analysis, to break concepts and behaviors down into teachable steps (youtube example: https://youtu.be/SLBLnNxzftM). It is one that has shown the best results for educators within public and private school systems, and data collection is a vital component.

Data collection allows everyone who teaches the child to stay on the same page.  Parents and educators work together to shape behaviors and teach concepts, and therefore it is important that both parties are aware of what is going on. A child may perform well at home but not at school, or vice versa. In such cases, data collection and visualization play a key role in allowing parents and educators to work together to see what differences are creating the problem.  They also allow all parties to determine the behaviors that are the most immediately necessary so that everyone can work on teaching the same thing.

Learning problem
ASD is a difficult disorder to understand, as each individual's symptoms and needs varies widely. And therefore it may be difficult for special ed teachers, especially those with less experience, to feel as if they do not have progress in enhancing the learning experience of their students. Often times, teachers may feel frustrated and feel like they are not see teacher progress if they do not see student improvement right away.

Solution
"Student Tracker" keeps track of student progress based on Daily Learned Units, where teachers are able to input daily data. Weekly comparisons allow teachers to understand individual student's learning curve, and allows them to easily compare student progress. This method of data collection and visualization helps teachers as learners themselves perform better as teachers, even if they are frustrated about not seeing immediate student progress.

This user flow diagram visualizes our whole product concept, however for this project, we created a small demonstration of the the initial data entry and visualization experience. The user flow for this is as listed below:
1) Teacher presses button to move into different modes: data entry, contact other schools, and resources.
2) If the teacher presses "START", he is taken to the data entry page, where he needs to select the week and day in order to input quantitative and qualitative data. Once this is entered, it is visualized on a graph (quantitative) and in words (qualitative).
3) If the teacher presses "Contact Parter School", he is taken to a part school website, where he can search for more information or get teacher contact info.
4) If the teacher selects "Resources", he will be taken to a page where he can get more information on publications related to CABAS, which is the school's method of curriculum.
